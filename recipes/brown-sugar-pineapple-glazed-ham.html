<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 (6 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
    <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans pineapple juice</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham, cut-side down, into a roasting pan.</li>
    <li>Cut skin off pineapple with a sharp knife and slice off any brown spots or skin left behind. Cut pineapple 
        into 1/2-inch-thick rings and use a round cutter to remove cores. Pin rings onto ham with toothpicks.</li>
    <li>Bake ham in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>While ham bakes, mix pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power 
        until glaze is boiling and slightly thickened. Work carefully because glaze will be sticky and very hot.</li>
    <li>Pour 1/2 of the glaze evenly over ham and pineapple rings. Bake ham for 30 minutes more, then pour remaining 
        glaze over ham.</li>
    <li>Continue baking ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham reads 140 degrees F 
        (60 degrees C), 30 to 60 minutes more.</li>
</ol>
